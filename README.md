# Fraud Detection with Sequential User Behavior

Online-lending fraud detection with customers' sequential behavioral data (End-to-end ML and NLP project).

## Project Summary


The project goal is to utilize customer’s behavior sequences before submission of the loan application to make fraud detection in the online lending business. We tried different kinds of machine learning classification models and deep learning methods including the state-of-art transformer model with attention mechanism to extract features and make the best prediction ability, measured by AUC and KS statistics.

## Background

In the previous fraud detection analysis, people usually focus on the users’ basic information like gender, age, income, family background, and their application date. Although these kinds of information could be treated as features and helped to build machine learning models to detect fraud, there was still lots of information lost during the process. One kind of information it lost was page view behavior. By the development of the Internet, now more and more lending is happening online. As a result, we can record the page view behavior for each customer. Thanks to the development of Deep Learning, we can make the page view behavior into sequence feature sets and fit them into different models.
